About
Amanda grew up in Michigan, and moved across the country at 18 to pursue her Bachelor of Science in Zoology at NC State University. Achieving that Bachelor of Science in Zoology lead to her first love, Zookeeping. Caring for wolves, tigers, and cheetah was the professional love of her life, but unfortunately a career of passion often does not provide enough financially to pay the bills and make a life. Zookeeping was no exception. An unexpected second love has become coding. The same problem solving skills that served her in college and in carnivore care have proven to make the endless puzzle of learning new languages a fulfilling new adventure.
